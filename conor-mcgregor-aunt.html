Even if you've never watched the sport, there's a good chance that you've heard the brash Irishman's name. Or rather, "formerly brash" Irishman is what we should call Conor, because ever since he lost to Khabib Nurmagomedov, he's come back a bit of a changed man.</p><p>This is something that's evident in his latest Instagram post, which is dedicated to his dearly departed aunt and fighting the coronavirus.</p><p>The incredibly emotional post might seem almost out of character to people who haven't been keeping up with the Dublin-born pugilist as of late. Emboldened by his early success inside the cage, his forays into other businesses outside the octagon have also proven to be just as fruitful. His Proper 12 Irish Whiskey flew off of shelves immediately and still continues to sell just about everywhere ‚Äî a fact he's happy to promote on social media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">along with his clothing line</a>.</p><p>There was a time when Conor McGregor's Instagram feed was filled with callouts of other fighters and cocky posts of self-aggrandizement, but he seems to be more focused than ever on sharing his renewed passion for training, spending time with his family, and giving props and love to his community.</p><p>Even in his last fight with Donald Cerrone, Conor seemed a completely changed man. Gone was the cocky and demeaning fighter and in his stead was a same fierce competitor who showed nothing but respect.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Ireland you amazing, amazing country. I believe we have this virus contained. And through this containment, we actually may have gone and contained them all. The good habits we will have now gained from this wild covid-19 attack will see us too strong in future. Hand hygiene. Touching of own face hygiene. Consistent thorough cleaning of handled areas hygiene. What we should really be all doing anyway. I have always been on with my hand hygiene. But not enough. If I think of all the people approaching to shake hands and what not. I often get people say to me please I don‚Äôt want a picture, just let me shake your hand. And I‚Äôm like yes friend thank you. As it‚Äôs more efficient than taking a full picture. But it‚Äôs too careless. And too frequent. Touching my own hand to my face as well. Too unaware of the frequency I‚Äôd do it. Until now. I‚Äôd train my ass off, to the point of low immunity. It‚Äôs inevitable with the intensity of the training. The immune system will be tested. I would float around in this manner, and always end up catching little colds and flus. I feel bullet proof right now though! I‚Äôm switched on like a motherfucker now. Stay vigilant on our personal hygiene people. And our personal space. God speed to us all ‚ù§Ô∏è We are not there yet but we are well on our way. On our way in a big way! To the people of the world. We will do this! We are doing this! It‚Äôs done. We did it. Congratulations! Oh And it‚Äôs summer time now too. Wow! Oh and Who am I fighting. ... These photos are from a few days ago at a studio in Dublin‚Äôs City centre. I was to announce to the world my @properwhiskey donation to @Tunnel2Towers. A great day! A proud day, I brought my family with me to the studio. Sitting in the chair about to beam live to all the U.S morning talk shows, I get a phone call telling me that my lovely little auntie Anne had passed away. I couldn‚Äôt go live anymore. My poor little friendly loving auntie. My mother‚Äôs sister. This stupid fucking virus. What the fuck is happening. I took my family to bull island. Looked out at the sea. Took a deep breath. Thank fuck! Lord thank you üôè Stay tight people!

However, a follow up post revealed that she was tested and as it turns out, she didn't contract COVID-19 or any other strains related to the illness.
