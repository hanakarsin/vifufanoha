"I guess all the backlash last time didn't faze her. You will not get away with this! You are a disgusting human being and karma will get you," one follower commented before another added, "Can't believe Bravo hasn't cancelled this poor excuse of a mother."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by wigzncigs (@wigzncigs)</a> on Oct 14, 2018 at 8:29am PDT</p></figure><p>Despite the photo "proof," Kim is denying the allegations, responding to her mommy shamers on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. "People are *$&#ing SICK!! Get the &#^$ out here!! No post was taken down and no photo has been nor will ever be edited of my children! I will no longer stand for this bull#^$#," she wrote.&nbsp;However, this is not the first (nor will it probably be the last) time that Kim has been dubbed a "bad mom" by haters on the internet.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Remember that time she offered John Legend her daughter's "services" for free concert tickets?&nbsp;</h2><p>Kim was in hot water after she asked John's wife <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a> just what Brielle Biermann, who was 20 years old at the time, had to do to get see him perform live. "Sooo ur hubby is comin to ATL may 19 and Kash is beyond OBSESSED w him! Who does Brielle have to blow in order to meet him?? LOL," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jokingly asked</a>. Her fans, unfortunately, were not laughing.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"Plz don't blow anyone it's not that good of a show. Jk it's good but I'll get you tix without the oral," Chrissy responded before followers started dragging Kim for the NSFW humor. "Just a suggestion, but you know you can just go on Ticketmaster and not pimp out your daughter?" one Twitter user suggested. Another added, "This is a 'joke' that totally crosses the line. Kim you are dumber than I thought you were for not deleting this by now."&nbsp;</p><p>Brielle did come to her mom's defense, explaining in a since-deleted video that, "My mom is not pimping me out. That tweet was my choice."&nbsp;Right...&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Or when she bought Brielle a handgun two weeks after the Parkland shooting?&nbsp;</h2><p>For her birthday, Brielle received a gun from her mom and stepdad Kroy Biermann — and fans were not impressed. "I'm moving out on my own, I don't want to live without a gun. I'm scared of my own &$^@ing shadow," Brielle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told photographers</a> of the gift. "I think it's fine to have a gun as long as you're mentally stable. I think the rules and regulations need to be a little more.. than what they are now."&nbsp;</p><p>She also made it clear the weapon was purchased before the school shooting, adding, "He bought it before and had it custom made... he bought it before. It took awhile."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about that time her daughter Ariana Biermann wore a shock collar?&nbsp;</h2><p>Kim took to Snapchat to share videos of her then-14-year-old daughter willingly wearing a shock collar and agreeing to get shocked in order to hang out with her friends. Again, Kim and Kroy were criticized for their poor parenting decisions. "Sometimes in life you have to just not post things on social media. My word, just sad that she posted what she did," one fan pointed out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Snapchat</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Speaking of dogs...&nbsp;</h2><p>Last year, Kim's 6-year-old son Kash was attacked by one of the family's four-legged pets and sustained serious injuries to his face. "I don’t know where to start. The last 14 hours of our lives has been a living nightmare. My sweet&nbsp;@kashbiermann&nbsp;was bit by a dog and had very traumatic injuries. I’ve never prayed so hard, or been so scared in my life," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a>. "Kash was in the operating room for a couple hours and now we are praying for a quick speedy recovery. " Luckily, Kash made a full recovery.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>However, her decision to keep the dog who bit her son did not sit well with fans. "It was not an attack — he nipped at Kash’s face in an attempt to communicate with Kash. Not that that is an excuse. But he took off running. It wasn’t as if he was attacking. Sinn knew&nbsp;he had done wrong," Kim explained. "If Kash ever looked at me and said that he didn’t want to be around Sinn or showed any hesitation, then he wouldn’t be here. We love Sinn, he’s part of our family, but our children will always come first without a doubt."&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the case, Kim is one protective mom when it comes to trolls on the internet. When body shamers were attacking Ariana, Kim did not hold back. "My sweet, smart, motivated princess @arianabiermann," she wrote. "She has the biggest ?? and is even more beautiful on the inside and you LOW LIFE &#*holes who have the audacity to make your rude comments, 'she finally lost weight' 'she finally came into her own.'"</p><p>And Kim didn't stop there. "WTF is wrong with you! You are the problem with society. What possesses you to sit behind a computer and write a negative comment?" she continued. "Can you imagine if you took the time to write something positive or nothing at all how wonderful this world would be!!! You leave my baby alone she is a child!!!! Got it!!! #YouHaveNoClueTheImpactYouHaveOnSomeone #SheIsAChild #GetALife #IfYouArentPositiveUNFOLLOW #EachOneOfMyGirlsAreUniqueAndSpecial."</p><p>Are you #TeamKim?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZqaF9mhXCmym2ioqhfoLauedmoo5yhkaB6sbTOraasoJ%2Bl</p></div><div id=links><a href=./384527-raila-na-bwenyenye-jimmy-wanjigi-wahudhuria-harambee-ya-kanisa-bondo-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Raila na bwenyenye Jimmy Wanjigi wahudhuria harambee ya kanisa Bondo</a>
