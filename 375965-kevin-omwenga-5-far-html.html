This has prompted questions to be raised about gun licensing and the misuse of firearms in the country. His wealth has also caused debate on how fraudsters are conning themselves into riches at the expense of innocent people. Here are 5 things we know about so far:</p><h3>1. Kevin was a car dealer</h3><p class=align-left>Omwenga used to work as a car dealer for Lystra Motors in Lavington, Nairobi. He was paid commissions for his sales. He was also an enthusiast for fast cars and had just acquired a Porsche Panamera weeks before his death.</p><p class=align-left>The new car is reported to have cost him around Ksh. 10 million. What remains a mystery is how he was able to move from a car dealer who survived on commission to be able to afford such a fancy car within months.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d66ef1194fc99b0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Drama at UK Airport as Grown-Up Man Claims to Be Aged 15, Begs on Knees Not to Be Returned to Nigeria in Video</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Looking at a few of Kevin Omwenga photos, one can tell that he lived quite the fancy lifestyle. He partied in his apartment and kept to himself most of the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/283ffc33a9a4cb58.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Who is Nandi Kegode? Quick facts, alcoholism story, and photos</p><h3>2. Chris Obure and Robert Bodo remain the key suspects</h3><p class=align-left>Robert Bodo was involved in the murder of Kevin Omwenga and was captured by CCTV going into the victim’s apartment several times on the day of the murder. Robert claims he had given the murder weapon to the victim so that he could show off to his girlfriend.</p><p class=align-left>According to him, he accidentally shot the victim when the gun was being handed back to him. Chris Obure is a suspect in the murder because Robert Bodo is his bodyguard. Also, the gun in question belongs to him.</p><h3>3. Omwenga and some of his business associates were planning to travel to Dubai</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3a4ac3b110f8a36d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Young Man Finally Becomes American Citizen After Years of Staying Abroad</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Omwenga and some of his business associates were allegedly planning to travel to Dubai to meet a client on a gold deal. Preliminary findings point towards a deal gone bad.</p><p class=align-left>This provides a motive for the murder. Mr Chris Obure has been accused of being a fraudster on several occasions which is why it is believed he might have short-changed Omwenga in the deal leading to the disagreement.</p><h3>4. The trajectory taken by the bullet rules out an accident</h3><p class=align-left>According to the key suspect, it was an accidental release from the gun that killed Mr Omwenga. This claim can be disputed on several levels. It might not make sense why the two had to go all the way to the bedroom to hand a gun.</p><p class=align-left>That aside, detectives investigating the murder claim that the trajectory that was taken by the bullet as it pierced through Omwenga’s heart and then hitting the wall rules out the possibility of an accident.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

Chris possessed the gun illegally</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d66ef1194fc99b0.jpg><p class=align-left>The gun belongs to Chris Obure, but then again, he has some explaining to do on how it ended up at the scene of the crime. The businessman also has some explaining to do on why he still owns the gun.</p><p class=align-left>This is because he had been declared an unfit gun holder following accusations of assaulting and causing bodily harm to another person. On the other hand, Bodo is not approved to own a firearm. So how and why did he come to be with Obure’s gun?</p><p class=align-left>Kevin Omwenga had moved from struggling to pay rent to living in one of the high-end neighbourhoods of Nairobi. He had just arrived and was living on the fast-lane, but his life came to an end abruptly. That is too much of a price to pay for any amount of riches, but then again no one can tell what fate has in store. The suspects are in custody but what remains is to put the pieces of evidence together. This will help in ascertaining whether it is murder or manslaughter as Omwenga’s family waits for justice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3e25355d3b4980e7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paul Kirui: Joy as 53-Year-Old Man Returns Home after Spending 21 Years in Jail</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Wanja Wohoro: 10 quick facts you need to know about the musician</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke outlined on 12th August 10 facts about Wanja Wohoro.
