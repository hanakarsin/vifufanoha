not receive N100 Million from the former National Security Adviser, Colonel Sambo Dasuki for election campaign of his political party.</strong></p><p>[article_adwert]</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt1psh2alb3s6g.jpeg><p>The former presidential candidate told Channels Television in the evening of Sunday, January 10 in a telephone call from Ondo state that the N100 million he received was from the former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s Board of Trustee (BOT), Chief Tony Anenih. He said the sum was received under certain conditions.</p><p>Chief Falae who was also a former Minister of Finance under the military rule of Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida felt wrongly accused during the phone call. He threw light on his alleged involvement in the sharing of the $2.1 Billion Arms Deal money under the former government.</p><p>According to the interview on Channels Television, Falae said: <i>“Absolutely false! I never had any dealings whatsoever with the former National Security Adviser, Colonel Sambo Dasuki. No relationship at all!</i></p><p><i>“What I know was that Chief Tony Anenih, chairman Board of Trustee of the PDP approached me before the last election (presidential election of Saturday, March 28, 2015) to seek the cooperation of my party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) with his own party in re-electing the former president (Dr Goodluck Jonathan) in what they could call an Inter-Party Cooperation Agreement. And I gave him 6 conditions before we could accede to that request.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Dasuki Arms Scandal: Convicts To Lose Properties – Buhari</p><p>The frontline politician who was kidnapped a few months ago highlighted the conditions he gave the Jonathan administration before he collected the N100 Million.</p><p>The 6 conditions were:</p><p>1. That Jonathan’s government must prosecute insurgency in the North East more seriously.</p><p>2. That his party was not happy with the level of corruption in the PDP government and if they are to support the party, the PDP government must pledge to adopt a policy of zero tolerance for corruption.</p><p>3. That Jonathan’s administration should expeditiously re-structure Nigeria, by implementing the reports of the 2014 National Conference.</p><p>4. That the PDP led federal government should pursue the creation of jobs for the masses as a priority.</p><p>5. That the PDP government should reduce current expenditure by raising capital funds for development.</p><p>6. That if the PDP wins the election and accepts all those conditions, his party that is the SDP will support them and will expect them to play some roles and be part of the new government.</p><p>After the Ondo state born politician listed the contents of the agreement reached between Chief Anenih and himself, he went on to clarify on the arms deal scandal saying:</p><p><i>“Those are the 6 conditions I gave him and he accepted them in our discussions in my house here in Akure. After the discussions, he left. And for me to formalise the matter, I wrote an extra note conveying those 6 conditions and asking him to confirm my acceptance.</i></p><p><i>“A few days after, he wrote back accepting those conditions and to see that all the organs in their party agreed to those conditions. In fact, they were happy with them and they were ready to cooperate with us on that basis. So, with the change of letters, we had an agreement which I then presented to my party EXCO which approved the arrangement.</i></p><p><i>“And then after that he (Chief Tony Anenih) phoned me and said he knew the SDP was a poor party and will give it money to campaign for the president and other candidates. And that he would want to send us some money and he did which is the N100 Million we are talking about. I then passed it on to the SDP which then allocated the money to the various state branches of the party for the presidential and other elections. That is what has happened.”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3p9lm1rZpyRqMKstcaaq55lZmKwsLrDoquip56oeqit1Z5ko6eelsGprc1mmqiknJqwtbXNoGSnaWBleq61y6WgqKZdm66trcRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./best-of-edinburgh-fringe-2022.html>&#171;&nbsp;Best Comedy Shows of the 2022 Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a>
