The beloved spinoff series is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">airing on Bravo from 6 a.m. ET until 2 p.m. ET</a>, and as the series' single season was filled with so many gems, it's hard to believe the D.C. iteration only lasted one season.</p><p>What happened to The Real Housewives of D.C.? Where are the stars of the series 10 years later? Here's an update since the series ended a full decade ago.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was 'The Real Housewives of D.C.' canceled?</h2><p>True fans of the Bravo reality series know that Real Housewives of D.C. was historic. Not only was the D.C. iteration <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first and only Real Housewives franchise to get canceled after only one season</a>, according to Cheat Sheet, but it also had one of the most memorable scandals of all time when Michaele Salahi and her husband at the time, Tareq, crashed a White House dinner. It was a seriously unforgettable moment in reality TV history.</p><p>With millions of viewers and decent ratings, many were surprised that RHODC was canceled, but apparently, the D.C. backdrop made everything a little more political, and prevented the full-blown ratchet drama that most seasons get to experience. Some also think it may have been due to the birth of <a href=#>the much more popular spinoff, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>. Needless to say, the way it ended did not make way for another season, though many of the series' stars seemed to anticipate one.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Since the finale, Mary Amons divorced her hubby.</h2><p>Two years after RHODC ended, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Amons divorced her husband of 26 years</a>, Rich Amons, according to Page Six. It doesn't seem as though she has remarried. However, according to Taste of Reality, she tends to spend most of her time with her five kids, while also running her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interior design company</a>, Mary Amons Design.</p><p>Mary also relocated to Dallas, Tex., for her design company, so it seems if there's a RHODC reboot, she probably won't be in for it... unless of course she moves back for the sake of reality TV.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lynda Erkiletian seems to be laying low.</h2><p>Lynda seems to have fully retired from the dramatic life of reality TV, and these days, she seems to be focusing more on her career than anything else. Her Twitter bio boasts that she is the founder and president of a modeling firm called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@theartistagency</a>, and is also executive director of a charity that supports arts and sciences, called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jpcoburnfdtn</a>.</p><p>Despite the fact she is twice divorced with four kids, it seems as though Lynda's life is overall quite peaceful, according to her laid-back Instagram activity. It does, however, seem as though she tries to stay relevant with various Hollywood connections and by attending random events, so maybe we'll see a reality TV comeback for our dear friend Lynda.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Let the fun begin #Volta #cirque du Soleil</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Lynda Erkiletian</a> (@thereallyndadc) on Jul 25, 2019 at 5:04pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cat Ommanney hasn't given up on reality TV just yet.</h2><p>Cat ended up moving out of D.C. and all the way back to England, before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divorcing her White House photographer husband, Charles Ommanney</a>, according to New York Daily News. These days, she apparently spends a lot of her time in Spain while her kids attend boarding school somewhere else.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Cat tried to start her own British reality series a few years back, but it doesn't seem as though it's taken off yet. We're hoping for the best, however, as Cat's brutal honesty was truly perfect for reality TV.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stacie Scott Turner is slaying in the real estate biz.</h2><p>Ten years after the series ended, it appears that Stacie Scott Turner has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gone back to her roots in real estate</a>, according to Trend Celebs Now, as she owns a real estate company in Maryland. At one point, Stacie may have been working on a televised project called Redesigning Your Life, but it doesn't seem like that ever took off either. &nbsp;</p><p>According to Washington Post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacie and her husband, Jason, have also parted ways</a> since the series wrapped... what could have been.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please VOTE for my TV Show 'Redesigning Your Life' <a href=#>@whuttv</a> <a href=#>#mybigshow</a> <a href=#>http://t.co/5V3eIgDCA5</a> PLS Retweet!

According to The Washingtonian,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michaele had gone totally MIA for a while</a>, and many, including her husband at the time, believed she had actually been kidnapped. However, it turned out that she was simply getting hitched to Journey's guitarist, Neal Schon. She divorced Tareq, and ultimately married the love of her life.</p><p>It's unclear what Michaele does for work now, except for basking in the fame and wealth of her has-been rockstar husband.
