One section read that she “Didn’t ‘lose’ her battle. She ‘won’ four years of her life while diagnosed with stage four cancer.”</p><p>Tessa’s illness and death were a significant part of Rehab Addict Season 8. In July 2018, Nicole explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> that shooting and editing the season was much more challenging than other seasons.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“She was battling cancer, and we didn’t expect her to die so suddenly,” Nicole said, “I have two sons, but Tessa was like my daughter. This season was really hard to edit without us all bawling our eyes out.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since Tessa’s death, Nicole has found ways to make sure Bobby’s daughter isn’t forgotten. In February 2019, the HGTV star cut off a foot of her hair to raise money for children with hair loss due to cancer or other medical conditions. On her page, Nicole said she grew her hair out for months so she would have over a foot of hair to donate.</p><p>Bobby’s family also remembers Tessa whenever they can. The contractor honored his child with a charity that spreads awareness and accepts donations for children living with cancer.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bobby also uses his account to reflect on his time with Tessa and several photos of them on the fifth anniversary of her death.</p><p>“I can’t believe it’s been five years!” Bobby captioned under his post about Tessa. “It seems like yesterday I was holding her in my arms (I miss that). I miss her a lot! It’s hard to talk about, but I just say hold your loved ones close; you never know.”</p><p>Watch Rehab Addict: Lake House Rescue airs Thursday nights at 9 p.m. on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7yjrthmp6unpJ2ys7uMpKCdqw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./george-foreman-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;George Foreman - Age, Family, Bio</a>
