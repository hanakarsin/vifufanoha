He knows that the news is not what fans want to hear, but getting medical treatment for his mental health issues is of the utmost importance for the star.</p><p>‚ÄúAfter talking to the team at MTV, we have mutually agreed that I will step away from the show while I seek medical treatment for mental health issues that I‚Äôve ignored for too long,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúMy No. 1 goal now is facing my struggles head-on.
